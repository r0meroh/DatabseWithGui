# DatabseWithGui
A Database using sqlite3 and tkinter.

This was a database created and modified to introduce dynamic interfaces and databases to the students that I teach python 
lessons to.

    This program is made up of a backEnd python file that is integrated with a GUI on a seperate file named frontEnd.py. The gui
has text fields that can be updated in real time. 
    The search capabilities also are in real time and return information 
based on the amount of matching criteria within the search. For example, when one text field is filled in with a common 
text shared upon multiple entries, all those entries are returned. The more text fields filled in, the more specific the return 
becomes, up to the point of a singular match.
    The delete function is implemented in a way that allows for a user to highlight an entry by clicking it or by typing it into the text fields.
    The GUI also has the capability to display all entries upon request by pressing the update button.
    All this runs in realtime and there is no need to restart the program after any change is made.
